### Technical Assignment Challenge: Object-Oriented Programming in Dart

This technical assignment challenge is designed to assess a learner's understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Dart. The challenge should be pushed to GitHub and the solution should be submitted via a link.

The challenge is to create a program that has the following features:

1. An object-oriented model that uses classes and inheritance
2. A class that implements an interface
3. A class that overrides an inherited method
4. An instance of a class that is initialized with data from a file
5. A method that demonstrates the use of a loop
